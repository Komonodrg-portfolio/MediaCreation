# üñºÔ∏è Media Creation

<h2>üåê Overview</h2>

This repository documents the tools, equipment, and workflow I use for creating media content to support my IT projects and tutorials. This includes:

- <b>Building and designing this GitHub portfolio</b>
- <b>Creating screen recordings and technical walkthroughs</b>
- <b>Producing content for platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and LinkedIn</b>
- <b>Sharing insights into IT workflows, setup guides, and project explanations</b>

The goal is to provide a transparent look into the behind-the-scenes production process of sharing technical knowledge.

<h3>üéØ Purpose</h3>

- <b>To support my personal brand and professional outreach not only in IT, but mission work</b>
- <b>To demonstrate documentation and communication skills</b>
- <b>To inspire others on how to document and share their technical journey</b>
- <b>To organize media assets for reuse and collaboration</b>

<h2>ü™Ç <em>"One Man's Thoughts..."</em></h2>
<em>No one comes in to this world with all the answers.  Like an baby, we must come up to speed through trial and error to strengthen our knowledge base.<br>

Though pretty tech savy, my experience in <b>Media Creation</b> was in it's infancy.  Leveraging the power of AI, I was able to get pretty current through curiosity and consistency.  Knowing the importance of branding now-adays in a culture where attention spans are diminishing (a gift & a curse of technology in the ease it provides), sometimes it's just not about knowledgability, but visibility.<br>
<br>
While leveling up my experience in my IT professional interests, I felt the need not only to continue my learning journey but to concurrently show how to effectively market yourself.  Given my [mission](https://github.com/Komonodrg-portfolio/Mission/tree/main) for this portfolio repo, I aim to show how I went from intially crawling to running towards my career passions. I hope this repo serves as a great benefit to all in their pursuits.<br>
<br> 

Colleages, Onward.
